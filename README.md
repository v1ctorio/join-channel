# Join my channel

Easy and fast to deploy tool meant to replace private-channel join request Slack workflows. Built with serverless support in mind, using hono as it's only dependency (no bolt).

## TODO

- [ ] Implement oauth for the website button
- [ ] adapt it so it works well in cloudflare workers
- [ ] create dockerfile because yes
- [ ] make documentation to deploy your own instance

## Start dev env

```sh
deno task start
```
